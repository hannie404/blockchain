<!-- 
    I coded this website the day when the mini project was announced.
    Back then, bootstrap wasn't introduced to us yet.

    You will notice how untidy was my home page, I tried to make it
    responsive using css only. That's why it wasn't coded well. Nevertheless,
    I achieved my desired output even if it wasn't the best.

    As you may notice, I used the nav area and the footer area as my template for the other pages so that I don't have to code it again. Both are also messed up because of the same reason.

    I am planning to fix my home page but due to the shortage of the given days
    to make this mini project, I decided to prioritize making the other pages.
    I am planning to fix this soon when I have time.

    Thankfully, with the help of using bootstrap, I managed to make the other pages more responsive and easy without making long css styles.
